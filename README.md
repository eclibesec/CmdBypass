# CMD Bypass Exploit Terminal
# Description
CMD Bypass Exploit Terminal is a web-based terminal interface designed to help security researchers bypass restrictions on executing system commands in environments where critical PHP functions have been disabled.
This terminal utilizes advanced object-oriented programming techniques to bypass disable_functions settings in PHP. It allows users to execute commands even in highly restricted environments by exploiting the way PHP handles closures and object references.
# Features
- Bypasses disable_functions in PHP configurations.
- Executes system commands in restricted environments.
- Real-time display of command execution output.
- Supports advanced object-oriented payloads.
- Works on PHP 7.3 to PHP 8.x.
